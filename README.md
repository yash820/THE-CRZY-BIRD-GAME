# The Crazy Bird Game
### Overview
The Crazy Bird Game is a simple yet engaging arcade-style game built using the Pygame library in Python. The objective of the game is to control a bird character and navigate it through a series of pipes, earning points for successfully passing through openings between the pipes. The game features a welcome screen, a main gameplay loop, and various sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.

### Features
Welcome Screen: Players are greeted with an initial screen that provides instructions on how to start the game. The welcome screen waits for user input to either start the game or exit.

Main Gameplay Loop: The core of the game is a loop where the player controls a bird character. The bird's vertical position changes based on user input (flapping) or gravity, and the player must navigate the bird through a set of pipes by avoiding collisions.

Scoring System: Players earn points by successfully passing through openings between the pipes. The current score is displayed on the screen, providing a competitive aspect to the game.

Obstacles: Pipes act as obstacles for the bird. The game dynamically generates new pipes, and the player must navigate through them without colliding.

Sound Effects: Various sound effects, such as flapping wings, point scoring, hits, and game over sounds, enhance the gaming experience and provide auditory feedback to the player.
